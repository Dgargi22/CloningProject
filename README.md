# CloningProject
A static front-end clone of the Amazon.com homepage built entirely with HTML and CSS. This project focuses on replicating Amazonâ€™s layout, styling, and design elements without using JavaScript. It was created to practice HTML structure, CSS styling, responsive design, and layout techniques.
